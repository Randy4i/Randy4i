- 👋 Hi, I’m @Randy4i
- 👀 I’m interested in IOS, Web and android development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about all of the above given there is always so much excitingdevelopment in all of software development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web projects as I feel I am neglecting this area and I need a reason to get stuck in more.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Well I need to work on that. So if you are reading this and you need a collaborator, please give me a minute.
